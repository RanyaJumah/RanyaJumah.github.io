I am a PhD student at the Systems and Algorithms Laboratory (SysAL) at the Dyson School of Design Engineering, Imperial College London. I supervised by Dr. David Boyle and Dr. Hamed Haddadi. Before that, I studied a BS in Computer Science at Taibah University and an MS in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Leicester. I am interested in the Internet of Things (IoT), Deep Learning, Data Security & Privacy, and their intersection. In particular, I am interested in designing and building systems that enable better use of our digital footprint, while respecting users' privacy. Recently I focused on preventing companies from collecting emotion data about users in voice-controlled applications.
